# eventd

_eventd_ is an event sourcing API built on top of commodity infrastructure

## Status

_eventd_ is under heavy development at the moment. It is developed as an experiment and it does not have a clear roadmap. I do not expect anyone to test it or contribute at this point. If you want to contribute please reach out using _Issues_ and I will get in touch with you.
